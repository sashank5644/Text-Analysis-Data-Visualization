# Text Analysis with Treemap and Sankey Diagram

**Overview**

This project provides an interactive tool for analyzing character distributions within a given text. It utilizes D3.js to create a treemap visualization for character counts (vowels, consonants, and punctuation) and a Sankey diagram to illustrate the flow of characters before and after a selected character.

**Features**

* Treemap Visualization: Displays the distribution of characters (vowels, consonants, punctuation) within the entered text.
* Sankey Diagram: Shows the flow of characters before and after a selected character, illustrating how often they appear in relation to one another.
* Interactive Tooltips: Hovering over the treemap and Sankey diagram nodes reveals detailed information about character counts and flows.
